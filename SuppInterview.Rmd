### Introduction

In an effort to help Hassett Willis understand the capabilities of applicants for data centric roles we often ask for examples of past work. In some instances past work is not publically available or the candidates may simply not have examples readily on hand. In these cases we ask applicants to take a look at a data set and generate a few different things to showcase their capabilities. Using the sample data set here, please provide responses to the following:

1. Tell us something you find interesting about the data.
2. Make a couple visualizations and provide explanations for why you chose them.
3. What about data processing? What do you see that you might change? Complete some transformations.

You can use any tools you want to complete the above. We are particularly interested in R Studio and Tableau at this time.

- Download [R Studio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) 
- Download [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/s/)

### Getting Started

If you decide to use R the data is can be accessed by calling 'airquality' from the datasets package:
```{r}
library(datasets)
head(airquality)
```

Or you can download the data from [github](https://github.com/kpipkins/HassettWillisInterviewSupplemental)

### Desired Output

There aren't any wrong answers or time limits. We use this process to gauge applicants familiarity with specific tools and processes. We don't expect you to spend any more than 30 minutes to an hour preparing your responses. Questions were designed to be open ended and left to your interpretation. Keep in mind ease of use and customer experience when deciding how to deliver a solution.

### Submitting your work

This is also open to your interpretation. If you use R or any other programming languages please provide your code as either a text document or you can point us to a github repo. Be sure to include links to any external tools you might use (ex:Tableau Public or Google Charts). Word documents, PDFs, HTML docs, and other standard file types are acceptable and of course combinations of any of the above is fine.
